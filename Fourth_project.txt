step1: create a project using the command.

step2: create an Application using the command.(where manage.py file is present there you should create App)

step3: Open sublime text--->click on project--->click on Add folder to project--->bring the project folder
sublime.

steps to create template folder at Project Level
----------------------------------------------------
click on projectname--->click on new folder and provide the name template.
click on template folder--->click on new folder and provide the appname(fourthdapp)
click on fourthapp folder--->click on new file and provide the name display.html

step4: go to settings.py and provide the info about the app name and template.
click on settings.py--->If you scroll down you will find a list with the name INSTALLED APPS, within this 
list provide the appname.

steps to configure template
---------------------------

click on settings.py--->If you scroll down you will find a list with the name TEMPLATES, within this list
you have dictionary DIRS:[], now within the value part of this dictionary provide the path of template.

ex:
# Build paths inside the project like this: BASE_DIR / 'subdir'.
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve(strict=True).parent.parent

DIRS:[BASE_DIR / 'template']


step5: from settings control automatically goes to urls but before configuring about views, first create views.
In views Bussiness Logic can be written in 2 ways:
1)function based view
2)class based view

Open the views.py file and write the logic using fucntion based views.

step6: Once logic is written open urls.py and configure in such a way that from urls control should go to
views.py.

Configuration in URLS(Function Based View)
*Add an import statement
	from appname import views
*Add a URL to urlpatterns
	path('',views.functionname,name='functionname')

Step7: Once all this is done run the server using the command.

Advantage

Now the project is executable in any system.
