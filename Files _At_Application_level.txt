Whenever we create an application in django, it creates 6 files and one folder as shown:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)__init__.py:
	It is a blank file and Django Framework treats our folder as Package because this file is present 
within our folder.

2)Admin.py:
	In this file, user has to register the models created in the application, by doing this through the
admin GUI we can provide the data to the database.

3)Apps.py: 
	In this file, we have to specify the application specific configuration.

4)Models.py:
	In this file, the user has keep information of application specific model.

5)Tests.py:

6)Views.py:

return the response to the user.
