Ninth Project
-------------
Create a Project using Django Framework which has multiple Applications and display the msg and image based on
view of an application that is under execution.(urls at Application)

Note: If the image and style of the web page should remain same for entire project, then static folder must be
created at Project Level.
*Whereas If the image and style of web page keeps varying from application to application within in a project,
then we should create static folder at Application level.
