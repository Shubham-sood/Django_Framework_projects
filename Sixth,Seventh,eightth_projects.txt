Sixth Project
-------------

Create a Project using Django Framework in order to display a msg, image and also the
time in the browser by creating the template at Project Level and static folder at Project level.

Seventh Project
---------------

Create a Project using Django Framework in order to display a msg based on the view that is executing.

Eighth Project
--------------
Create a Project using Django Framework which has multiple Applications and display the msg and image based on
view of an application that is under execution.

Disadvantage:
-------------
3Application--->8 configurations in urls at project level

100Apps---->250 configurations in urls at project level

In order to overcome the above create a urls.py at application level and configure only that application
